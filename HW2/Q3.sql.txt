-- I define 'sickest floor' as the floor with the highest number of positive patients so far.


-- Q3. Write a query to output the 'sickest' floor
--Q3-1.Oracle only
SELECT floor, count(floor) as count_floor
FROM (SELECT e.EID, e.floor
      FROM Test t, Employee e
      WHERE test_result = 'positive' and t.EID = e.EID)
GROUP BY floor
ORDER BY count_floor DESC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY;

--Q3-2. General query
SELECT e.floor, COUNT(e.floor) as count_floor
FROM Test t, Employee e
WHERE test_result = 'positive' and t.EID = e.EID
GROUP BY e.floor
HAVING COUNT(e.floor) = (SELECT max(cnt_floor) From (SELECT count(e.floor) as cnt_floor
                                                        FROM Test t, Employee e
                                                        WHERE test_result = 'positive' and t.EID = e.EID
                                                        GROUP BY e.floor));
